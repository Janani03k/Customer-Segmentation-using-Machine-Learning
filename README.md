# Customer-Segmentation-using-Machine-Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on one of the key applications of machine learning: Customer Segmentation using the K-Means Clustering Algorithm. The objective is to segment the customer base into distinct groups based on attributes like gender, age, interests, and spending habits to maximize profit and optimize marketing strategies.

## Project Aim

The project aims to find the best customers using segmentation methodology and explores the data to build a segmentation model, focusing on descriptive analysis and implementation of the K-means algorithm.

## Objectives

- Identifying potential customer bases for product sales.
- Implementing clustering algorithms to group the customer base.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

An analysis of the distribution of male and female customers is performed to understand the customer demographics visiting the mall.

## Methodology

Employed Jupyter Notebook for coding and used several libraries including Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit Learn, and Seaborn for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

## Implementation

The project explains the concept of clustering and uses the K-Means algorithm to partition the dataset into distinct non-overlapping subgroups. The Elbow Method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters.

## Results and Conclusion

Explored five customer segments based on the Annual Income and Spending Score, leading to insights for targeted marketing and customer retention strategies. The project concludes that effective customer segmentation can significantly enhance marketing efficiency and customer service.
